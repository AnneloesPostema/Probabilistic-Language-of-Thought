Bachelor's thesis - How a Language of Thought model can predict human pattern perception in binary sequences 
Anneloes de Moel (2024)

a) Basic project information
	This study examines how effective a probabilistic Language of Thought (ploT) model can predict human pattern perception in binary sequences. Based on Jerry Fodorâ€™s Language of Thought hypothesis, this research aims to address the gap in our understanding of how well a pLoT model can imitate humans preference for simplicity and pattern perception. The model makes use of Bayesian inference to probabilistically model human reasoning processes. The performance of the model was analysed against a statistical Streak Length Model (SLM) developed by Rao & Hastie (2023), who explored human belief updating based on streak length in sequences of 8 variables in binary events when predicting the 9th variable. The results of the comparison indicate that the pLoT model generates a more accurate prediction of human interpretations in a binary sequence task, indicating a better performance than the SLM when predicting the 9th variable of a sequence. The findings support the hypothesis that human cognition and pattern perception are ideally understood through symbolic and probabilistic reasoning. This research has many implications for cognitive science by offering a different look at human pattern perception.
